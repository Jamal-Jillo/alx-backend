# Cache

A caching system is a mechanism used to store frequently accessed data in a fast-access storage layer to reduce the time required to access the same data from a slower storage layer. Caching systems can be implemented in hardware or software and are used in a variety of applications, such as web servers, databases, and operating systems.

FIFO stands for "First-In-First-Out" and refers to a caching strategy where the oldest item in the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache is full.

LIFO stands for "Last-In-First-Out" and refers to a caching strategy where the most recently added item to the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache is full.

LRU stands for "Least Recently Used" and refers to a caching strategy where the least recently used item in the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache is full.

MRU stands for "Most Recently Used" and refers to a caching strategy where the most recently used item in the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache is full.

LFU stands for "Least Frequently Used" and refers to a caching strategy where the least frequently used item in the cache is the first one to be removed when the cache is full.

The purpose of a caching system is to improve the performance of a system by reducing the time required to access frequently used data. By storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage layer, the system can avoid the time-consuming process of accessing the slower storage layer, which can be critical in time-sensitive applications.

Caching systems have some limitations, such as a limited cache size and the potential for data inconsistencies between the cache and the slower storage layer. Additionally, caching systems may not be effective for data that is accessed infrequently or for data that changes frequently, as the cache may not have the most up-to-date data.
