# 0x00 - Pagination

## Description

Pagination is a technique used to split a large amount of data into smaller chunks. This is useful when you want to display a large amount of data in a user-friendly way. For example, if you have a list of 1000 users, you don't want to display them all on a single page. Instead, you can display 10 users per page and allow the user to navigate between pages.

## Requirements

    -   The function must be called `index_range`:

    -   Prototype: `def index_range(page, page_size):`
    -   You have to use this prototype for the file `0-simple_helper_function.py`
    -   You are not allowed to import any module
